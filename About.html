         <h1>About Our Project</h1> 
         <p>As we all know that corona virus cases in the world increasing rapidly the infection and death rates are increasing day by day so the problem arise that how to know about every place i.e where the cases are more and vice versa. So to solve these problems we are creating a graph in which we can know about death rates infections of cases around the world and the tracker is also included.With the help of covid 19 tracker we can know about active cases,death rates,infection rate,and recovery rate of corona cases around the world.This application identifies the containment zones and highlights the need for taking further precautionary measures for combating Covid-19. The application has been tested in various locations and has been found to yield accurate results. The application can be further used for many purposes like maritime and forest safety to prevent users from entering restricted areas.
